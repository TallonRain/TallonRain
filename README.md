## Hi there, I'm Kyle

### Systems Administrator & Software Engineer

Experienced systems administrator, network engineer, cloud architect, computer scientist, cybersecurity engineer, gamedev hobbyist and dorky adventurer who loves crafting robust and scalable solutions to interesting and unique technical problems.

In my down time I can be found exploring the world, enjoying some music, taking photographs from the ground to the sky, reading books, or saving the world in video games. I also enjoy cooking and skiing.

I have extensive familiarity with many technologies and fields ranging from enterprise SaaS solutions to web development to CAD & 3D printing. I have my hands in a little bit of everything and always looking for more.

I primarily write Python, C#, Rust, TypeScript, and C++.

Currently I'm interested in the Unity Engine and various applications of artificial intelligence.
