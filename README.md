## Hi there, I'm Kyle

Experienced systems administrator, network engineer, cloud architect, computer scientist, cybersecurity engineer, gamedev hobbyist and dorky adventurer who loves crafting robust and scalable solutions to interesting problems.

In my down time I can be found exploring the world, enjoying some music or saving the world in video games. I also enjoy cooking and skiing.
